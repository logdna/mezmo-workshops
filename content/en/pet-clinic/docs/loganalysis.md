## Connect OpenTelemetry to the PetClinic logs

In this section, we will update the **OpenTelemetry Collector**'s configuration to read the logs output by the PetClinic app and forward them on to Mezmo.

To get started, we'll need to modify the `receivers` section of the **OpenTelemetry** configuration to add a **filelog** receiver.  This receiver will be responsible for reading the `/tmp/petclinic.json` file into the running collector.

1. Edit `$HOME/otelcol/config.yaml` and add the highlighted lines to the configuration under the `receivers` section:

    ```yaml {linenos=table, linenostart=1 hl_lines=["3-15"]}
    #######################################
    receivers:
      filelog:
        include:
          - /tmp/petclinic.json
        include_file_name: false
        start_at: end
        operators:
          - type: json_parser
            timestamp:
              parse_from: attributes.timestamp
              layout_type: gotime
              layout: '2006-01-02 15:04:05'
            severity:
              parse_from: attributes.level
    ```

2. With the new receiver defined, we need to add it to the `logs` pipeline.  Under the `service` &rarr; `pipelines` &rarr; `logs` section, add `filelog` to the list of `receivers`:

    ```yaml
    service:
      pipelines:
        logs:
          receivers: [ otlp, filelog ]
          exporters: [ logging, mezmo ]
    ```

3. Save the configuration.
4. Restart the collector:

    ```bash
    ./otelcol-contrib --config config.yaml
    ```

## Browse PetClinic logs in Mezmo

1. Restart the PetClinic app:

    ```bash
    java -jar target/spring-petclinic-*.jar --spring.profiles.active=mysql
    ```
   
    the console logs will appear locally as:

    ```bash
    ...

               o.s.b.a.w.s.e.BasicErrorController:

    ```

2. Navigate to **Mezmo** at https://app.mezmo.com.  In the dashboard, click the **Views** button (<img src="../../images/views.png" width="40px"/>) &rarr; **Everything** (<img src="../../images/everything.png" width="175px"/>).  You should see the same log entries appear at the bottom of the dashboard:

    {{< figure src="../../images/petclinic-logs.png">}}

3. Each log entry can be expanded to reveal additional details and metadata about the log entry by clicking the disclosure icon <img src="../../images/disclosure-closed.png" width="15px"/>:
   
    {{< figure src="../../images/log-details-1.png">}}

    You'll notice that the additional metadata information being output by the PetClinic app like `context`, `level`, `logger`, and `thread` appears in the `_meta` portion of the log entry. We can query on this information by entering it as a search string field.  For example, if we wanted to find all entries where the `logger` is `HikariPool`, we could enter this search string:

    ```bash
    _meta.logger:com.zaxxer.hikari.pool.HikariPool
    ```

    which would give us a filtered view that only includes the entries we wish to see:

   {{< figure src="../../images/hikaripool-searchresults.png">}}

4. Having a filtered view that isolates only the logs coming from our PetClinic app is very convenient.  Let's save this View so it can easily be recalled in the future.  At the top of the log view, click the **Unsaved View** drop down and select **Save as new view**:

   {{< figure src="../../images/save-as-new-view.png" alt="Save As New View" width="350">}}

5. Name the new view **PetClinic App**, leave the **Category** and **Alert** fields blank for now.

   {{< figure src="../../images/create-new-view.png" alt="Create New View" width="350">}}

   Click **Save View**.

6. The new **View** is saved under the **Uncategorized** group of views on the list:

   {{< figure src="../../images/petclinic-app-view.png" alt="PetClinic App View" width="250">}}

   Now, anytime we want to view only the logs from the PetClinic app, we can click on this view to see the filtered set of log entries.
